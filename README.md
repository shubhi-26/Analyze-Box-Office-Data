# Analyze-Box-Office-Data-with-Seaborn-and-Python
This was the part of the coursera guidede project.
This project is based on Analyzing Box Office Data with Seaborn and Python.
The motion picture industry is raking in more revenue than ever with its expansive growth the world over. 
Can we build models to accurately predict movie revenue? Could the results from these models be used to further increase revenue?
I tried to answer these questions by way of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this project. 
The statistical data visualization libraries Seaborn and Plotly are used to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs.
